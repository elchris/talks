Description
-----------

Imagine building an application without having to mess with a Web Browser, a REST client or a MySQL client. What if you could build full-blown functionality with realistic data operations within the comfort of a Unit Test Harness?

What if this meant shipping code earlier and more frequently than you ever have before?

Building upon concepts outlined in this talk: [http://bit.ly/tdd-talk-2](http://bit.ly/tdd-talk-2) , and leveraging an evolving "Kata" for building a "Ride-Hailing Application", this exercise will walk thru a rapid-development example from a "clean-slate" Symfony3 project, with just enough bootstrapping to enable Test-Driven Development with PHPUnit & Doctrine.


To get ready to follow-along the tutorial, please complete the "Initial Setup":
