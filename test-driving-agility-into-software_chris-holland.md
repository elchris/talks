Description
-----------

Despite our agility, we can't ship software at a sustained pace.

With so many companies "becoming agile", nobody bothered to inform the software upon which they depend, that it too, should be agile.

If you ask of any company these days whether or not they consider themselves to be „agile“, the vast majority will answer in the affirmative, and proudly point you to the many „agile processes“ they follow, and „agile tools“ they use.

And yet … in spite of all this „agility“, as our meticulously-planned „sprints“ take longer to execute, as our backlogs fill-up with overhead having nothing to do with core business value, as it gets exponentially difficult to predict just “what” is going to be delivered and “when”, it feels like just about every software project we end-up working on, doesn’t quite deliver on this feeling of overabundant „agility“.

As we explore these challenges, Test-Driven Development will emerge as an effective tool to increase our productivity and our overall ability to ship software at a sustained pace.
